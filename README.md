Comparing Intracranial Access Efficacy of the Hubly Drill vs. Hand-Crank Drill through Conducting Survival Analysis of Patient Length of Stay in ICU

Problem: Patients with hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, cancers of the nervous system, brain tumors, epilepsy, and subdural hematomas often undergo surgical treatments which rely on intracranial access. Intracranial access today is performed both inside (180,000 procedures U.S. annual) and outside (20,000 U.S. annual) of the operating room. The current bedside procedure relies on an inaccurate, hand-crank drill deficient of any safety features. This shortcoming is manifested by the 40% misplacement rate of catheters during intracranial access procedures and the 3-attempt average for functional catheter placement. 50% of bedside and 10% of operating room intracranial access procedures yield patients‚Äô suffering from infection, hemorrhage, stroke, neurological injury, and death. Our company is solving the problem of high failure rates for intracranial access procedures both inside and outside of the operating room.

Solution: Hubly Surgical is a cranial and orthopedic platform tech drilling solution. We are first advancing intracranial access, for which 205,000 life-saving procedures are performed U.S. annual...with 20% failure. The Hubly Drilling System is designed for safety, saving lives and hospitals billions through reducing complications. Our products follow a Class II 510K regulatory pathway, and we‚Äôre currently in cadaver studies. Hubly is run by neurosurgeon serial entrepreneurs and lifelong medical device engineers. We are also partnered with Northwestern and Stanford Hospitals for testing and piloting our solution.

The patent-pending Hubly Drilling System - innovative both at the bedside and in the OR - includes (1) automatic, electrical plunge prevention; (2) battery power ‚Äî rather than wired, electric power as in the operating room; (3) hardware catheter guidance utilizing the proven Ghajar guide technique, which has been proven to facilitate accurate freehand placement; and (4) unique drill bits which provide additional mechanical plunge prevention.

Study: We are doing first in-patient pilots with Dr. Juan Felipe Huidobro at Van Buren Hospital in Valpara√≠so, Chile. On average they have 12 EVDs performed each month. We expect half of these procedures to be performed with the Hubly Drill. Therefore, over the course of 6 months we expect about 36 procedures to be performed with the Hubly Drill compared giving us an ùëõ=36. It will be about a year and a half before we will have data from 100 patients who have undergone the Hubly drill and 100 control patients.

The data we have access to will be: (a) deidentified patient demographics (b) user testimonial (c) patient ICU length of stay (d) pre-op MRI/CT Scans (e) post-op MRI/CT Scans (f) patient readmission

From this data we can retrieve the following numerical data points:

Sex (a)
Age (a)
Distance of drill plunge (b)
Procedure length of time (b)
Patient ICU length of stay "LOS" in days (c)
Change in damaged area pre vs. post-op (d) & (e)
And we can compare this extrapolated data with standard control groups using (a).

Project Purpose: I am creating a model in advance to analyze the data collected from these pilots. First, I want to learn whether the patients who undergo the Hubly drill have different length of stays in the ICU than patients who undergo the current drill. This analysis will determine Hubly's cost-savings value to hospitals, and more importantly, will be an indication of Hubly's having improved outcomes for patients. To create this model prior to collecting real data, I have used relevant medical studies and random generators to create a database of 200 hypothetical patients.
